<p> The purpose of my project will be a fundraising platform where users will be able to gather financial contributions and raise donations. It is similar to a go fund me. The application will consist  of two  buttons, a login button and a register button upon landing page If the user choose register from the landing page then the application will navigate the user to the campaign form where the user will be able to fill their user information and donation amount, then after completing the campaign form the application will go on the campaign profile while on campaign profile the application will show their current donation and who donates. The campaign profile consists of two buttons that includes one option to log out and if the user logs out then the application will send the user to the login page and the other option consists on who sees the fundraiser.
